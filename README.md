## Usage
> Just like YouTube(It's super downgraded version of youtube but), you can create an account and post a video to the server and other people can watch the video that you posted

## Bug
> This is my first deployed application, so there's a mistake on that deploy process. i might fix this bug, or make another whole application later.
